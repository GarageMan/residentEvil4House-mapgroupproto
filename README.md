# residentEvil4House-mapgroupproto

Just copy/paste the lines into your mapgroupproto.xml (e.g. after </defaults>
Adjust the range and hight - I recognized some objects will spawn below the house ;-)

Adjust the lootmax to a value you like (10 is currently the max, because the list consists of 10 relative spwan locations)

Add the Resident Evil 4 House workshop to your server.

Add at least one spawn location for the "land_re4_house" to your map (see example for my Namalsk server: Dovecote camping site)

Have fun - and let me know adjustments you made.
